# Overview

I *often* build from Ruby [official base images](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/), install additional software packages, and do some basic Ruby housekeeping (installing Bundler and making sure the system Gems are up-to-date). Building against [`2.4.2-jessie`](https://github.com/docker-library/ruby/blob/73d3ed6b06738a7457a24fba9024cad303829c0a/2.4/jessie/Dockerfile) on a 2011 iMac and a decent Net connection, this can take about *20 minutes.* Repeat this half-a-dozen times over the course of a day and you've lost two hours. As Orwell wrote, *doubleplus ungood.*

This repo offers four variations on (presently) a single Ruby version:

* `2.4.2-jessie`, `2.4-jessie` `2-jessie`, `jessie`, `2.4.2`, `2.4`, `2`, and `latest` are all built from [this `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/jdickey/docker-ruby/2.4/jessie/Dockerfile). It is built from the official `ruby:2.4.2-jessie` build, with both the below [base software](#base-software) and [Qt4 software](#qt4-software) installed, as well as the current version of Bundler at the time the image was built (presently 1.16.0);
* `2.4.2-jessie-no-qt`, `2.4-jessie-no-qt`, `2-jessie-no-qt`, `jessie-no-qt`, `2.4.2-no-qt`, `2.4-no-qt`, `2-no-qt`, and `no-qt` are all built from [this `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/jdickey/docker-ruby/2.4/jessie/no-qt/Dockerfile). It is built from the official `ruby:2.4.2-jessie` build, with the [base software](#base-software) installed **but not** the [Qt4 software](#qt4-software). The current version of Bundler is also installed;
* `2.4.2-jessie-slim`, `2.4-jessie-slim` `2-jessie-slim`, `jessie-slim`, `2.4.2-slim`, `2.4-slim`, `2-slim`, and `slim` are all built from [this `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/jdickey/docker-ruby/2.4/jessie/slim/Dockerfile). It is built from the official `ruby:2.4.2-jessie-slim` build, with both the below [base software](#base-software) and [Qt4 software](#qt4-software) installed, as well as the current version of Bundler at the time the image was built (presently 1.16.0);
* `2.4.2-jessie-slim-no-qt`, `2.4-jessie-slim-no-qt`, `2-jessie-slim-no-qt`, `jessie-slim-no-qt`, `2.4.2-slim-no-qt`, `2.4-slim-no-qt`, `2-slim-no-qt`, and `slim-no-qt` are all built from [this `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/jdickey/docker-ruby/2.4/jessie/slim/no-qt/Dockerfile). It is built from the official `ruby:2.4.2-jessie` build, with the [base software](#base-software) installed **but not** the [Qt4 software](#qt4-software). The current version of Bundler is also installed.

Yes, that's 32 tags for 4 images. ðŸ˜©
